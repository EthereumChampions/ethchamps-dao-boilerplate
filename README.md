# DAO Boilerplate

## Goal
Our goal is to provide resources for the enginneering of scalable Decentralization Democratic Organizations. We aim to accomplish this by providing a 'boilerplate DAO' which others could use as a reference for their specialized DAOs. 

## Why DAOs?
[Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org) provides many excellent reasons. Here's a few:

- Completely transparent voting process through an Ethereum contract, which collects member proposals and submits them. 
- Immune to any outside influence as itâ€™s guaranteed to execute only what it was programmed to.
- Provide services with a 100% uptime guarantee via the decentralized Ethereum network
- The organization can act as an entity. It can:
  - own tokens
  - participate in crowdsales
  - and even be voting members of other organizations.
- Utilize DAO bots and services to create stakehold value and organizational efficiencies.
- DAOs may lead to the people becoming more empowered.
  
## Roadmap
Initially, this boilerplate will basically be a complied version from the [Ethereum Guides](https://www.ethereum.org/dao). Over time, we hope to become more than that.

Here's what we want to tackle:

### Core
- Membership
- Voting Rights
- Proposals
- Minimum quorum for proposals
- Minutes for debate
- Margin of votes for majority
- Reads and Writes Permissions
- Penlties
- Testing
- DAO Preferences
- Crowd Equity
- Contract Upgrades

This is an open-source project and we'd love any help we can get <3.
